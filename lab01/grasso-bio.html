        Emma Grasso

        I am majoring in Finance and Marketing Management, with a minor in Information Management and Technology and a milestone in Fashion and Beauty Communications. I am interested in pairing marketing and fashion in the future to hopefully work for a luxury fashion company, either in marketing or merchandising. I just completed an internship this past summer in the off-price fashion industry as a buying intern. I am very driven, detail-oriented, and a diligent worker. Outside of the workplace, I love to cook and experiment with new recipes. I love to shop in my free time and love anything fashion-related. My favorite show now is Sex and the City because it combines all my favorite things now: New York City life, fashion, and friendships. I am originally from Atlanta, GA, and am the oldest of three girls. I still have an appreciation for my Southern roots, but I am hopeful to move to Manhattan, NY, upon graduation!
