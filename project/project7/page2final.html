            <h2>The Cost of Fashion</h2>
            <p>Fashion sustainability is about both what we can do as consumers to limit how much we buy, along with ways companies can be more environmentally conscious in the production process. Many brands are making genuine changes to their practices, both environmentally and ethically. However, some are using this as an opportunity to hop on the bandwagon and simply market themselves as sustainable without making any real efforts to change their company. This is a term known as greenwashing, and consumers need to be aware of which companies are genuine and which are not while shopping.</p>
            <p>While there are many benefits to the fashion industry, the trend of overconsumption in our culture has led it to be one of the most destructive industries to our environment. This is due to the concept of fast fashion, which can be defined as the rapid production of inexpensive clothing to meet the demands of ever-changing fashion trends. Because of the consumer’s values of newness and trendy items, sustainability is sacrificed because clothing companies have to rapidly produce clothing to be sold in the short window they are deemed to be “trendy.” After this, the clothes are essentially discarded. Consumerism as a whole has created a culture of buying too much and discarding the items soon after.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clothing production has doubled while garment usage lifetime has decreased.</li>
                <li>Fast fashion generates more CO2 than aviation and shipping combined.</li>
                <li>More than $500 billion are lost every year due to lack of recycling and clothing utilization.</li>
                <li>20% of global wastewater comes from textile dyeing.</li>
                <li>We discard 92 million tons of clothes-related waste each year.</li>
