            <h2>My Experiences in Fashion</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, fashion has been one of my passions.When I was in elementary school, my role model in fashion was my mom. She always encouraged me to dress myself before I could even go to school and would allow me full creative authority. My mom inspired me to prioritize what I felt comfortable in and the styles that I was drawn to rather than wearing what everyone else in my grade was wearing. Overall, I love it because of the self-expression its allowed me to have, the creative outlet its supplied me with, and the self-confidence its given me. </p>
            <p>As Ive grown up, this passion of mine has fostered itself in not only my personal life but my professional life as well. With my interests in fashion, shopping and styling myself and my friends and family have also become a big hobby of mine. This past summer, I was able to leverage these skills Ive developed since I was young as a buying intern at Burlington Stores in New York City. I channeled the confidence and self-expression that I grew up valuing in the fashion industry and applied that to the customers I was buying for. I was able to leverage the benefits Ive gotten from fashion onto others and bring more consumers into the industry that has given me so much.</p>
            <p>In the industry overall, there are a plethora of perks. While fashion sparks creativity among us, it also ignites it amongst the entire fashion community. It is an industry where newness and the abstract are praised and allow for free-thinkers and creatives to thrive. There is always an opportunity to create a new design, collaborate with a new stylist, or travel to a new city for the fashion weeks that are in various global cities. It is an ever-changing, fast-moving environment that makes everyone feel as though they have a place in it.</p>
