            <h2>Expressing Identity through Style</h2>
            <p>Fashion is a way to self-express, but it extends far deeper than expressing ones style. For many people, it is a way to represent who we are, our values, and how we feel from day to day. Many view fashion as a way to honor our individuality. Throughout history, people have reflected their culture, politics, and religions through clothing, and this has allowed people to express themselves without having to say anything.</p>
            <p>Fashion can be vulnerable and personal, but the commonalities amongst what we wear create community. This is what the fashion industry is all about. We find common ground and connection through what we wear, but we also celebrate what makes each of us unique individuals. As you scroll through my page, I urge you to consider: What do your clothes say about you?</p>
