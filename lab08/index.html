        <h1> Emma Grasso's Biography</h1>

        <p>I am majoring in <strong>Finance and Marketing Management</strong>, with a minor in Information Management and Technology and a milestone in Fashion and Beauty Communications.</p>
        
        <p>I am interested in pairing marketing and fashion in the future to hopefully work for a luxury fashion company, either in marketing or merchandising. I just completed an internship this past summer in the off-price fashion industry as a buying intern. I am very driven, detail-oriented, and a diligent worker. </p>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Outside of the workplace, I love to cook and experiment with new recipes. I love to shop in my free time and love anything fashion-related. My favorite show now is Sex and the City because it combines all my favorite things now: New York City life, fashion, and friendships. I am originally from Atlanta, GA, and am the oldest of three girls. I still have an appreciation for my Southern roots, but I am hopeful to move to Manhattan, NY, upon graduation! </p>
